gentle-cms
==========

# Mission
We want to bring a lightweight and efficient approach to content
management and we believe that version controlling is the best way to
tackle editing.

# Principle
There exist two stages:
* pre-publication: Content that is being actively edited and need to be
  polished. In short the work in progress.
* published: Everything that is freely available to the world

# Installation
´´´curl url/setup.sh && ./setup.sh´´´
